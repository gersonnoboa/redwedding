## Name explanation
The [Red Wedding](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Wedding) is one
of the most important events in the TV show Game of Thrones. Although a lot
of people was involved in its execution, none of the characters (or the viewer) 
were aware that something was being planned. I adopted the name because
of the secrecy that occurred around the events, and this app deals with
encrypting information that is supposed to be secret and accessible only by
the interested party (the final user).
